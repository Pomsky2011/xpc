The Compiler X+INF uses.

X+INF is a custom programming language that I thought of and want to bring to life. The source code will be 100% C/Makefile.

X+INF is heavily inspired by Java, as in it is compiled to an intermediate language that is then interpreted, and also is object oriented.

X+INF's ultimate goal is to outmatch the speed of other interpreted languages like Python, Java, and Lua.
